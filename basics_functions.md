## Mark and John are trying to compare their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula: BMI = mass / height^2 = mass / (height \* height).(mass in kg and height in meter). Dont use if.

Write function `compareBMI` whitch takes Mark's and John's mass and height.

1. Calculate both their BMIs.
2. Create a boolean variable containing information about whether Mark has a higher BMI than John.
3. Return a string containing the variable from step 2.

(Something like "Is Mark's BMI higher than John's? true").

- Example:
  - compareBMI(70, 185, 68, 187) --> true

## Write a JavaScript function `calcArea` to return the area of a triangle where lengths of the three of its sides are 5, 6, 7. Use Heron's Formula. Round result to 2 decimal places.

## Given two positive, `n` and `d`, returns the remainder of `n` after dividing by `d`.

- Example:
  - remainderOf(10, 1); --> 0
  - remainderOf(10, 2); --> 0
  - remainderOf(10, 3); --> 1
  - remainderOf(10, 4); --> 2
  - remainderOf(129, 17); --> 10

## Write a function "callNTimes" that takes two arguments: times (a number), and fn (a function). Execute the "fn" function "times" times.

- In this case, we assume that the person who is using "callNTimes" has defined their function, and is passing it into our function as an argument (ie: passing it around as a variable).

- Example:

  - callNTimes(5, hello)
    `Hello, world!`
    `Hello, world!`
    `Hello, world!`
    `Hello, world!`
    `Hello, world!`

  - In this example we assume there is a function "hello" already defined and that it prints "Hello, world!" to the console.
